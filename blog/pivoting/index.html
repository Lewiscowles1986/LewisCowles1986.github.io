				<p>Sometimes we pivot. We stop what we are doing as we are doing it and re-focus or completely drop that thing for another, maybe we pick a thing up.</p>
				<p>When we pivot, we often need to re-integrate new information. I am a programmer & architect so I will focus this on digital, but you may find it more broadly resonates with life.</p>
				<p>There is an awesome book by Seth Godin called "The Dip" which I thoroughly recommend everyone reads. it is more broadly about the pre-requisite to this. The decision to go head-down full-steam ahead or stop, pivot. it is about determination and strategies to ensure that you are mindful of not pushing forwards without constant evaluation of where this fits in to a broader strategy.</p>
				<h2>Know where you have come from</h2>
				<p>There is an old saying:</p>
				<blockquote>If you do not know where you come from, and where you have been, how can you know where you are going?</blockquote>
				<p>Try iterating over the following question for each pivot you would like to make.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What have you tried?</li>
					<li>Why did it not work?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you need to fundamentally change more than a little. It is highly likely you will have to revisit every single decision since the last point of change.</p>
				<h2>Know where you are going</h2>
				<p>Without a clear direction. You are as unlikely to succeed as you were before.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What makes this strategy, technology, or approach different?</li>
					<li>How sure are you that this will work?</li>
					<li>What is the impact of this not working?</li>
					<li>What does success look like?</li>
				</ul>
