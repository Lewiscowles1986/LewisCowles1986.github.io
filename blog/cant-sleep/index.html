				<p>Happy New Year!</p>
				<p>As my first post of the year, I won't talk about losing two people I was very happy to have on my work team; one of them a friend, the other I was getting to know.</p>
				<p>Instead, a short tirade about lack of sleep.</p>
				<p>Since my early life, I've always struggled with sleep patterns. I have a real control over when I wake up, if I'm not ready to pass out I can usually control micro-nap times; but I have almost no control whatsoever about inducing falling asleep.</p>
				<p>We used to have golden time when I was in school, where we could watch a program, relax and occasionally sleep.</p>
				<p>When I went to primary school, my mother had many jobs and I liked to stay up reading about classical and medieval history, passing the hours until she returned so I could wish her a good night and relay my love for her.</p>
				<p>It's not that I need less sleep than others. I really suffer from not sleeping at times it induces a futile mania. As example I've read 300 pages from 4 books over the past 2 days. It might be more useful to complete 300 pages of a single book, but I find my cup fills up and I have to switch to be able to retain information from an unrelated subject.</p>
				<p>I also sleep whenever I want. Middle of the day, after stressful meetings; when I can't crack a coding problem, I'll often wake up with a solution.</p>
				<p>So why am I blogging about sleep?</p>
				<p>Because I can't sleep and it's really frustrating.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I do credit some of my achievements to lack of sleep.</li>
					<li>I'd like to put a stake in the ground and work on better sleep for the future.</li>
					<li>I learned in 2018 it could lead to dementia.</li>
					<li>I'm not getting any younger</li>
					<li>I'd like to believe it will help with my health and happiness</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So how do some of you cope with not being able to sleep?</p>
