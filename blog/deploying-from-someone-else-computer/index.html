				<p>Today I got around to some changes I have been contemplating for a while. This site now deploys every time I commit to my main branch on GitHub, using their actions, docker, openssh and some scripting.</p>
				<h2>Why is this important to me?</h2>
				<p>I have been very lucky over the past few years, and had the opportunity to run a trio of operating systems, accross multiple computers. Every time I switch or set one back up I need to do setup to ensure tools are available for me to deploy my website.</p>
				<p>If running every major OS is not your bag, here are some more reasons to make this leap</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Less software on your computer.</li>
					<li>Less risk if you lose your computer.</li>
					<li>It is very cool to show-off.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Alternatives I considered?</h2>
				<p>I have been working with publishing websites for a lot longer than this personal blog lets on. I published my first personal websites in the 1990's. Here were some of my options.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WordPress, or other <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Bespoke hand-crafted site.</li>
					<li>SaaS solution like Wix, Siteground, etc.</li>
					<li>Static Gen, such as 11ty, hugo, jekyll (GitHub pages)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Ultimately, this site has been edited by hand for the past few years, and there is something about that I have enjoyed. Things I have not enjoyed have been, working out how to upload in few-enough keystrokes that I do not make mistakes, and editorial oversight.</p>
				<h2>My Vision for the site as a project.</h2>
				<p>I want to use this site as an experiment in note taking and improving my writing, within fairly extreme technical constraints.</p>
				<p>If I publish via GitHub, I can automate more of my process, deferring to their actions runners to ensure that complex logic and process are run for every commit.</p>
				<p>I Must stress at this point, I only have the site auto-scanned by lighthouse for the past year and the deploy, but these are small steps in a direction I am happy to be moving.</p>
				<h2>Would you like to know more?</h2>
				<p>The site source-code is publicly available on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/Lewiscowles1986/LewisCowles1986.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Here is my current site deployment GitHub action yaml file</a>. I forked a third-party repository so that I could audit the code, and also make some small changes. The repository I forked can be found via <a href="https://github.com/Lewiscowles1986/ssh-scp-deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">my personal fork of the code</a>. The main file of interest, which is the only file I changed, is <code>entrypoint.sh</code>, which I added a <code>GLOBIGNORE</code> directive, and force removed the private key after run. The file removal was likely paranoia on my part.</p>
				<p>The code uses GitHub secrets to ensure I am not publishing a private key, username, hostname, port or destination directory where anyone can see it. Hopefully this is paranoid enough.</p>
