				<p>I often try to frame data in a global context. When I think about if the world is better or worse, I use numbers to get me answers. I try to take numbers from reliable sources, but I'm not a research fellow or looking to publish journal articles.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>In the early 1980's, however, as economic growth slowed in the industrial nations, increasing the poverty of the developing nations, the pool of hungry people grew at a rate of nearly eight million a year, reaching 512 million in 1985, according to the World Food Council.
				<cite>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/world/world-hunger-found-still-growing.html</cite></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>There were 4.846 billion people in the world in 1985
				<cite>https://www.google.com/search?q=world+population+1985</cite></p>
				<p>There are 7.7 billion people in the world in 2019
				<cite>https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/</cite></p>
				<p>There were 7.3 billion people in the world in 2017
				<cite>https://www.google.com/search?q=world+population+2017</cite></p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>After steadily declining for over a decade, global hunger is on the rise again, affecting 815 million people in 2016, or 11 per cent of the global population, says a new edition of the annual United Nations report on world food security and nutrition released today. At the same time, multiple forms of malnutrition are threatening the health of millions worldwide.</p>
				<p>The increase – 38 million more people than the previous year – is largely due to the proliferation of violent conflicts and climate-related shocks, according to The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017

				<p>Nearly a third of a century has seen the introduction of internet, wifi, better living standards, access to technology and education in the part of the world I am from; where we don't regularly see 11% of people starve to death. Power is a thing of plenty. It cannot be right that 815 million possible Einstein, Currie, Lovelace, DaVinci, Nightingale, De-Grasse Tyson's of the future die needlessly, unable to attain the most basic of needs and dignity.</p>
				<p>I wish I had answers for this. I hope that lab-grown meat, advances in agriculture, GM, improved education and equality can help.</p>
