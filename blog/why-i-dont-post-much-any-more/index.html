				<p>When I started contributing more to this blog again, around 2019; after a burn-down-and-start-over approach to previous blogging attempts; I had a lot more time on my hands, and I did not practice personal journalling.</p>
                <p>Some of the less well put-together blog posts, should have been personal diary entries, that I did not share with the world, without a lot more editorial thought and process. As a result, I don't enjoy reading all the articles.</p>
                <p>I now diary and journal prolifically, both using open tools such as trillium, and platform tooling, such as apple notes.</p>
                <h2>Health</h2>
                <p>Over the past two years, I've had some health issues, due to a gargantuan kidney stone, that required invasive surgery. This is the first serious illness I've ever had, and the only operation(s) I have ever had. I am now recovered from my surprise relatively short-term ailment.</p>
                <p>I Am restarting my weight loss journey and have lost weight from the heaviest I have ever been at over 26 stone, or 160kg, to now 22 stone or 140kg, since May 2024; I hope to get down to at-least 100kg 15-stone.</p>
                <p>I've achieved this by using portion control, intermittent fasting, and surprise, surprise&hellip; [semi-]Regular exercise.</p>
                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>At work I have a new title, and another raise. <span>Staff Software Engineer</span>, to me is the same as <span>Technical Lead Software Engineer</span>; but I also got paid more, which I am somewhat happy with.</p>
                <p>Work-wise, I am very happy. There are folks I work with who cancel out most negatives, most of the time. I Am gutted that some people I adored have left the company. I remain childish that others remain.<br>C'est La Vie; it happens everywhere, anyway, for many different reasons.</p>
                <p>I still struggle with saying things, that absolutely do not benefit me to announce, to people who are unreceptive to the free-flow of specific ideas I share; so I guess that might be the next thing I work on.<br>It kills a lot of the joy, of &ldquo;bring yourself to work&rdquo; to then be told, oh no, not you. We want the PR version of bring yourself to work. Others may transgress, but not you! I persist regardless, knowing I have a home life, and friends who have not expressed such concerns, and remain amazed at my restraint.</p>
                <p>I have a strong peer pool that is enviable. Likely more than I've had in a while.</p>
                <p>I feel, like some of my "internet connections", are going better, which is cool, because I tend to get on better with folks in-person.</p>
                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm working with lots of python code at the moment.</li>
                    <li>We use AWS, at work, and I think I'm influencial and helpful there.</li>
                    <li>I know more Lucid, Draw.io, and Mermaid JS than I would have been happy about 2 years ago.</li>
                    <li>Folks continue to call me &ldquo;High-functioning&rdquo;, with regards to technology. I am assured no words are being omitted from that.</li>
                    <li>After years of complaining about MySQL; I'm using it, begrudgingly. The Oracle team are likely doing amazing things. But the legacy specs feel rose-tinted. So I am now re-introducing Postgresql.</li>
                    <li>Poetry, Justfiles and monorepos are now things I feel I have debugged enough to say I know &ldquo;quite well&rdquo;.</li>
                    <li>My logging and observability, and bent for not being creepy to users are shared, and our team is improving with good practices, including flourishes here and there.</li>
                    <li>I could go on forever, but I'll stop myself.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Closing</h2>
                <p>Anyway, that is it for now. Love to all the people that provide power to the positively electric communications we have. Best wishes to those who do not.</p>
