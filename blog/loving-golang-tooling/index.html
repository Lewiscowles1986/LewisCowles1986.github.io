				<p>I recently interviewed for a role as a Golang Senior Engineer. I wasn't very interested in the culture. There seemed to be a distinct lack of things I was excited about; even after the recruiter was kind enough to get back to me with more information. What it allowed me to do was make the excuse I needed to start compiling, testing, debugging things in go seriously for the first time in a little while.</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<h3>Finding time</h3>
				<p>As a generalist in computing, I often find myself torn between tasks. Things like writing a blog article, improving work documentation, finish passion-projects, be a good husband, be a good family member, brother, son &hellip;</p>
				<h3>Tooling</h3>
				<p>Another thing that can make it hard to "come home" or at least visit, is developer friction.</p>
				<p>There are many kinds of <dfn>developer friction</dfn> a term used to make tactile the feeling things could be better.</p>
				<p>The one type, or way I'm focusing on it here is technical or tooling friction. How long do I need to spend, before I'm set up?</p>
				<p>When I'm being a grump, I like to blame tooling for the rise of languages or pattens I don't enjoy existing. It's short-term enjoyable, but long term facile both to hate on languages and technologies, and to expect mass adoption without ubiquitous tooling.</p>
				<h2>What golang gets right</h2>
				<h3>10,000 foot view</h3>
				<p>A Bit like Python, which I also love; golang has some strong opinions.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Concurrency should not be an after-thought.</li>
					<li>Formatting consistency <em>IS</em> important.</li>
					<li>The standard library should be about more than passing a CS exam.</li>
					<li>Documentation, coverage, testing & debugging should be front and center!</li>
					<li>Types are important, but you should be able to work around the type system.</li>
					<li>Objects are a way of talking about relationships, we can borrow from.</li>
					<li>C is here. We'll need to play with it.</li>
					<li>You can (most of the time) deploy a single executable.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Comfort blanket</h3>
				<p>I have an authoritarian streak I cannot shake, so I rather enjoy being told off by a language for bad habits, and for it setting ground-rules. I should probably see a therapist about this, but typing with the ability to turn off when I'm desperate or stupid enough, is a wonder. I love strict typing, like I love expressive API's, but sometimes you need to get into <q cite="https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Johnny-Cash/A-Boy-Named-Sue">the mud and the blood and the beer</q> to get things done.</p>
				<p>I'm probably getting a bit boring so I'll wrap up this, but a standard library offering networking, common standards written in the tooling you use has amazing benefits for testing and understanding what the **** you're doing when stuck. Offering debugging and integration with support for expressing yourself similarly to other languages through interfaces etc, is also brilliant.</p>
				<h2>Me and golang</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Serverless functions using OpenFaaS</li>
					<li>API projects for high-throughput around payments and invoicing</li>
					<li>Command line applications without requiring extra runtimes or software</li>
					<li>File storage API for uploads</li>
					<li>Various test & exploratory projects</li>
					<li>Cross-compiling for multi-arch targets</li>
					<li>Understanding code such as CloudFoundry & Docker</li>
					<li>Understanding and (hopefully helping to re-organise) SQL in cockroach DB</li>
					<li>Integrating with Linux tooling for GUI's using Go & C-bindings</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I think it's safe to say that I'm still beginning my journey into all they can offer. I Feel a few new things came up</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A language-directed plugin build target, which looks promising for faster data-store-flexible systems.</li>
					<li>Cross-architecture builds, which I've paired with GitHub actions for an SMTP testing / control MailHog.</li>
					<li>Spec testing, specifically testing patterns.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>To conclude</h2>
				<p>I really enjoyed a jaunt with Golang and will endeavour to finish some of my newer projects using it. I am transitioning towards low-code, no-code and less-code solutions; because I'd like to tackle what I feel are some foundational issues for practical computing personally and for business; but I also love what 20 years has produced so-far, and cannot wait to be a part of the next 20.</p>
