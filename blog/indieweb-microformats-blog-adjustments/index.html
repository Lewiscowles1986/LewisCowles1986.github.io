				<p>So... this IndieWeb thing is pretty cool.</p>
				<p>This morning I spent a few hours (yes that's right hours), putting microformats onto this blog.</p>
				<p>It wasn't very difficult, or the first time I'd worked with microformats, but it was the first time I really understood them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>classes starting with p-* are meant to be text-only, or will be read that way</li>
					<li>classes starting with h-* are meant to be a container for a single entry</li>
					<li>classes starting with dt-* are meant to be a container for a datetime information</li>
					<li>classes starting with u-* are meant to be a container for urls</li>
					<li>classes starting with e-* are meant to be raw HTML</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This was actually spelled out in an excellent article I recommend you read <a href="http://microformats.org/2014/03/05/getting-started-with-microformats2" rel="nofollow">Getting started with microformats2</a></a></p>
				<h2>Minor grumble</h2>
				<p>Part of me is very unhappy that we should need to add more markup to websites to have machines parse them better. As an alternative I would prefer common markup patterns which do not clutter class names. I was already using article for my posts. Perhaps I should post headers with a single link, title etc using tags.</p>
				<p>I'm also upset about the HTML centricity of the IndieWeb. I've been writing HTML for over 20 years now and being paid to in-part generate and deliver HTML for over 17 of those years. It always felt like a stepping stone to me. Projects using SAX a Java XML technology have been working on compressing XML for years. This appeals to my fondness for efficiency.</p>
				<p>Ultimately size affects speed, and portability. Sure I have a &lt;50W <abbr title="Raspberry Pi 4 Single board computer with 4 Gigabytes of RAM">rPi4</abbr> which can run even the single-page monstrosity the startup I work for made; but I like to think we will continue to refine things which took a lot of resources to explore, so that the developing world can join in, and we can spend those savings on new exploration(s).</p>
				<h2>Future improvements</h2>
				<p>I have the most pathetic bare-bones implementation of micro-formats for a blog which right now is text.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm going to roll my own CMS like it's 2004</li>
					<li>I'm going to look to bring in some projects</li>
					<li>I have aspirations for pictures and diagrams</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Thanks for reading. Until next time.</p>
