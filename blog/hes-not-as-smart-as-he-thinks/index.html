				<p>This post is about me being dumb. Well, more about me being human... Okay so already I'm softening the blow.</p>
				<p>The thing is that we all feel like this sometimes. What made me feel like an idiot wasn't that I don't have intimate knowledge of the HTML working specification, or the entirity of it's JavaScript DOM counterpart.</p>
				<blockquote>Given a mature enough technology, and even most new-fangled shiny things; there are things we won't know unless we authored them.</blockquote>
				<p>This is a problem with Dry, technical documents. Not the only one, but one.</p>
				<p>It is more that a series of people didn't understand me in a row, and all threw their hats in to suggest things which had absolutely nothing to do with what I was trying to do. It felt almost deliberate, although I'm sure that was not the case. Like people were chewing at my time and effort.</p>
				<p>How wonderful to be helpful and to sometimes manage to help.</p>
				<p>It can be  frustrating to have someone tell you how to archive webpages when you've been doing it for 20-some years, when they are missing some important context you believe you've communicated clearly.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I wanted to backup my KanBan boards to HTML</li>
					<li>I did not want wrote-copies, but distilled, refined, altered ones</li>
					<li>I had a working prototype of both HTML and FileSystem</li>
					<li>I'd been working on refinements to the prototype to automate CSS, HTML fixes and file-system structure</li>
					<li>I then took on micro-formats because I was interested in what it might look like to make the HTML more parseable</li>
					<li>I then took on some accessibility and document structure, without significantly altering the appearance</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Communication continues to be a burden in some groups.</p>
				<p>Perhaps it's always been a problem, but it's highlighted more in some groups than others.</p>
				<p>Sigh</p>
