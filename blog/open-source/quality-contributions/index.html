				<p>Software quality can be such an overloaded term. Talk to a new software developer and the ideas might be related to commercially developed products they have experienced in the past. After a few years or working in the wrong teams, that bar might begin to resemble a game of limbo, where a minimum bar from the customer-side is the goal.</p>
				<h2>Hacktoberfest 2020</h2>
				<p>2020 has been a good year, right? Yeah, I know, a global pandemic, many people losing their jobs. You would think people writing software for-free, with all that comes with that would want free help.</p>
				<p>DigitalOcean runs a competition with free t-shirts every year, for people who get a certain number of contributions to Open Source during the month of October. The idea is simple. Incentivise people "in a fun way", to contribute.</p>
				<h2>So what is the problem</h2>
				<p>A lot of software developers do not like the contributions they have received through the program. Many of which they do not feel they need or want.</p>
				<p>While it is true that there are people seeking to add unnecessary words, such as "awesome" to bodies of code, I can think of many times when the right single word, would have helped me or those I help with coding.</p>
				<h2>Reading and Refactoring</h2>
				<p>Many OpenSource projects have policies against refactoring, and / or unreadable code. This leads to stagnant, hard to read code, which is difficult for people to make meaningful contributions to without a lot of up-front investment.</p>
				<p>Unless a coder can prove and extinguish bugs, they are out of luck getting into these ecosystems, which often have quite non-standard testing.</p>
				<p>WordPress is a famous example of this. I would argue PHPMyAdmin is another. Most older C and C++ codebases are also a problem. VCVRack for example, while a great piece of software specifically does not take patches. The VCVRack primary build system did not work, or only worked for the author last I checked, so there is no point in it being OpenSource.</p>
				<h2>My thoughts</h2>
				<p>The problem is not that people are contributing things, you do not deem worthy. In many cases I might agree with you about commits with the sole intent of getting free t-shirts. My agreement in those cases, does not make it an immutable truth of the universe.</p>
				<p>It is so hard to write good software, and what we do is write software. I think the larger issue is in what we do allow, how we approach code that gets merged.</p>
				<p>If you have never written bad code, you are an idiot or a liar. So perhaps get off your high horse or stop pretending to be OpenSource.</p>
