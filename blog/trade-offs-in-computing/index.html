			<h1><a href="/blog/trade-offs-in-computing/">Trade-off's in computing</a></h1>
			<p>One thing many people do not think about enough in life is trade-off's. I'm a little bit obsessed by them in some contexts, but accept that even paying attention to trade-off's is in itself an acceptance of cost. I Hope that cost is ameliorated with the ability to deal with situations which need that attention, to avoid being blindsided by over-optimism.</p>
			<h2>Compute vs Memory</h2>
			<p>Some of the most basic problems in computing are so cheap to solve, that storing the answer is said to take longer, or cost more than simply computing the value. One thing that is particularly interesting about this problem is that different people categorise cheap-enough to mean lots of things, including</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I don't care</li>
				<li>We've got bigger issues</li>
				<li>I don't understand</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A lot of easily accessible software testing is setup to measure correctness, or time taken. Particular care should be taken to ensure that serial, batch, concurrent and parallel test-cases are created when looking at compute versus memory.</p>
			<h2>Reproducibility vs Correctness</h2>
			<p>I can run something a million times and have it come out with the same result every time may be a strong signal that something can be correct, but it is in-fact only reproducible, not necesarrily correct.</p>
			<p>Good Mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists will be able to explain this better than I can, but I believe the version in my head is currently that a formally correct solution is both predictable and expressible in-abstract and is free of environmental constraints, expressible purely in mathematics.</p>
			<p>To my view, this means that most things in computing are often only reproducible given environment and context. Whilst it would give greater assurance to ensure they were formally verified as correct, the boundary disolves between theory and practice due to the need to engineer or manifest the academic.</p>
			<h2>Time</h2>
			<p>There exist various time-related trade-off's from parallel computing to memoization. I Expect I have much to learn of this area; however I regularly come across engineers that I need to broach the basics with. Algorithmic complexity as well as performance are two things I regularly see conflated. Complexity may achieve performance in narrow cases, but can be difficult to integrate to complex systems due to interactions between complex systems.</p>
			<h3>Parallel execution, saving critical path</h3>
			<p>There are many models of parallel computing. At it's most Raw you could consider three computers, two triggered by another to be a very simplistic model of parallelism. One of the reasons parallelism is so difficult for people to think about is that it is very rare for us as limited mechanical physical beings to experience individually.</p>
			<p>By using our naive three things mental-model it's easy to break the problem into a simple space. There has to be a method of communication, a way of splitting, combining and an envelope overhead for general purpose computing to distinguish the task from others.</p>
			<p>The benefit, a task which may take one computer 1 an hour to do, might take roughly 30 minutes if distinct halves are sent to each of the two comparable computers.</p>
			<p>The overall cost is greater as we've inferred 3 computers instead of one, and a communications, splitting and combining overhead. Lots of work has been put into this area of computing, specialised chips to avoid network overhead exist to allow on-die (on chip, shorter distance), the fact that it may be so cheap to divide the load the one computer can in-fact service many groups of parallel workgroups, and that when you get into the weeds on this, we may not be talking about general purpose computers any more.</p>
			<p>Essentially we say that we accept an additional cost in order to reduce our time of waiting.</p>
			<h3>Memoization</h3>
			<p>If we take a very large amount of computer time or resources to calculate something. Storing it and working out an address mechanism may prove beneficial to reducing time.</p>
			<p>When building my ERP connector software I had to take multiple systems that may not be reliably connected to, or in a known good state, and mediate information between them. If I had to talk to a west-coast USA server and a server not in the same building, we will have milliseconds to seconds cost. When considering a single transaction "oh it's just a few ms" might be an opinion. As more communications need to happen and more instances of types of communication need to happen, those milliseconds add up and produce undesirable aggregates. If someone then needs to ask my connector about the other systems it can show them a snapshot, which is a very specific form of memoization of the state at a point in time of the two systems.</p>
			<p>Memoization is not a perfect solution, particularly because you get issues where data changes, but if it takes you an hour to produce a complex report, which needs to be accessed by many people for the same purpose, or you need a single source of truth then it can be a remarkable benefit.</p>
			<p>This website uses a form of memoization called static site generation. If I served this site and at runtime computed this page, I would have naively 86400 generations of the same content possible in a single day from a single visitor pressing refresh once per-second. By saving a copy of the generated page, the CPU and memory costs are reduced massively. The stock exchange would not accept this though, so it has to be situationally, carefully used.</p>
			<h3>Reducing resolution</h3>
			<p>This is true of screen definitions 4k to 1080 or 1080 to 720 or 320, but also of sound, colour representation and numbers. If you can reduce the amount of information by deducing or settling on good enough, then you can generally lower the cost of computation.</p>
			<p>At it's most extreme think of rounding and range exclusion in primary mathematics. numbers expressed to their nearest thousand are a lot easier to think about than when including the numbers up to those thresholds. There are many techniques that use this, but the one I'll focus on here is the humble bit-field representation.</p>
			<p>In computing you have a series of bits which are often said to be 1 or 0, on or off. Representations of distinct values can be further attributed to individual bits at an extreme, so that compression can take place. One famous example of this is checking if a number is odd or even in binary, by checking the bit which represents the number 1, which is the only odd number in most integer formats I've encountered.</p>
			<p>I've used this technique for a variety of purposes. One of my favourites is to check on multiple values at once in a single operation, which is read-centric. I've used this for email classification, compliance, multimedia and games, and so long as you have enough results in a set to filter, it is remarkably fast. The cost trade-off in this case is initially computing a value and defining the type of check you wish to perform</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exactly matches</li>
				<li>Includes all of / Excludes none of</li>
				<li>Includes some of</li>
				<li>Includes none of / Excludes all of</li>
				<li>Excludes some of</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This pattern makes the most sense when you have 2 or more thresholded or absolute boolean values, such as has attachment on email, is known (but not how you know), can be taxonomically identified by, read/unread. It's not impossible to pack more complex values into these, but the goal is to perform a basic check which takes a single (or fewer) inexpensive operation(s) over many records instead of many operations (regardless of expense) over the same number.</p>
			<p>If you were to attempt this over 10,000 records with 4 checks, the result if you could compress to a bitfield of 4 bits would be 25% of the time + overhead to construct the comparison bit-field.</p>By <a href="https://www.lewiscowles.co.uk/" class="u-author">Lewis Cowles</a>
