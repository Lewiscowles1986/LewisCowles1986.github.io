			<div class="e-content">
				<p>It's been a while since I last posted. I've been struggling, not with content to write, but with the output I create as a response to having something to write. I've been angry lately, and upset and frustrated, distracted. While I doubt this has affected you, I'm sorry if it has.</p>
				<h2>Being pulled in many directions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Lots of people ask me to do lots of things.</li>
					<li>I'm a <em>life-long</em> learner.</li>
					<li>I'm married.</li>
					<li>I'm entering into becoming one of the middle generation of my family.</li>
					<li>I'm also working in the background on materials and supporting technologies to get ideas out of my head.</li>
					<li>I have a job.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>A Matter of perspective</h2>
				<p>A Very positive thing to come out of my interview where I've been working since October 2018, is a term from my former manager Ross. Ross suggested that I, and many members of the team are T-Shaped individuals. Now that might be a polite way of saying we're jacks of many trades, but I prefer to think we have more interests than those with a narrow, perhaps expert focus.</p>
				<p>Of many of the things I do&hellip; I'm not the best at any of them. I'm hopefully not the worst either. I like to think I'm at least good, perhaps exceptional in a few areas, just not top-dog.</p>
				<p>Being the best is only suited to team sports. I rather enjoy being able to work in a team, it spreads risk and lowers stress. However I have found team-play to be a continuum, where some are more accutely dependent on the team.</p>
				<h2>Attempts to place effort</h2>
				<p>My attempts last year, with regard to more focus seem to have proven that others don't want me focusing in minute detail on things I want to work on, and I don't want to focus in minute detail, without control of what I'm focusing on.</p>
				<p>I'm very sorry, but your font predelictions, pixel perfect designs and lack of attention to detail ruin my day!</p>
				<p>I'm generally not excited about doing what I'm told in head-down, toil-time. I expect nobody is, but most seem to cope better than me. Some things that specifically irk me.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How to convince people to <em>give up</em> <strong>their data</strong>.</li>
					<li>How to change pretty pictures, or make pictures prettier.</li>
					<li>How to empower the powerful, or increase their enjoyment of their lives at the cost of others.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I make great effort to try to use this to explain to others the value and the reasoning behind why a specific approach is important.</p>
				<h2>I'd like to change the world</h2>
				<p>For me that sentiment is not a, &ldquo;I'd like one thing to be different&rdquo; sentiment. I recognize for many there is one outstanding issue. If they could solve it, their world would be better. There is an end-goal. I don't have an end. If I improve something today, tomorrow I'm awake and frustrated by shortcomings in it or something else. It's exhausting, but seems to just be how I'm wired.</p>
				<p>I Accept that my life is probably more comfortable than many people, but until I cannot think of how to change it; I'm going to keep working to shape the world as I feel it should be.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How to convince people to <em>knowingly accept</em> me and those I work with <em>enhancing</em> <strong>their data</strong>.</li>
					<li>How to improve processes; present information effectively for a wide range of people.</li>
					<li>How to <em>uplift & empower</em> people who are underserved or underrepresented.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My want for a different world is almost entirely selfish.</p>
				<p>In recent years, what may be a future realisation has been rearing it's head. Perhaps I need to change the world for others. Perhaps that will not serve my interests, but harm them.</p>
				<p>Perhaps this won't be a momentary discomfort, but a permanent and irreversible change.</p>
				<p>Perhaps that will change the world.</p>
				<p>Perhaps that world would be better for more others.</p>
