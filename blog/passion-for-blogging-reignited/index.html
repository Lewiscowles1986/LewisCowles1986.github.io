				<p>Recently I caught up with some web logs of people I know online & offline.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/" title="Bob is a programmer, architect who has this blog.">Random Tech Thoughts</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://ollehost.dk/blog/" title="Olle is a software engineer and Ruby on Rails specialist I work with">Olle Jonsson's blog - Against entropy</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://roderick.dk/archives/" title="Morgan is a lead engineer where I work, Foodie and JS evangelist">The blog articles of Morgan</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://ben.balter.com/" title="Attorney, open source developer, product manager">Ben Balter blog</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>I have a passion for reading. I particularly enjoy good storytelling, some live music, and good company.</p>
				<p>Most days, excluding code; I spend a great deal of time at a computer reading. One of the subjects I enjoy is technology, but I also like to read about the lifestyles, travels, projects, and viewpoints of other people.</p>
				<p>Having been on the web for over two and a half decades, I have had lots of web-content to read through. My strong preference is for un-cluttered content, which I define as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A lack of active scripting, or progressive enhanced content</li>
					<li>A lack of advertising and tracking</li>
					<li>Rich media, from videos, audio, diagrams, interactivity, art.</li>
					<li>New ideas, exploration.</li>
					<li>Beautifully written guides that help me understand <em>why</em> as well as <em>what</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>While reading links and comments on Olle blog, going down the rabbit hole as it were, I also came across a new group I find interesting. The <a href="https://indieweb.org/" title="The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the corporate web">Indie Web</a>. It is a friendly, informative, and welcoming community with many helpful people.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://gregorymcverry.com" title="an educator trying to use the web to help engineer better teachers">Greg</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://tantek.com/" title="the co-founder of IndieWebCamp and works on open web standards at Mozilla">Tantek Çelik</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>I have admired Mozilla, who seem to be involved with IndieWeb for some time. It has that good feeling about an organisation with lots of resources, that is well established and gives back. I have even been lucky to know a few former and current Mozillians</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Frankie Gerard Thomas-Hockey</li>
					<li>Ross Bruniges</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As you might expect I am a fan of both Mozilla & it's people. I am excited to hear more about this community.</p>
