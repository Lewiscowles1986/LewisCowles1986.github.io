				<p>Hey, have you heard of infrastructure as code? Well then you'll love my new proposal coming to a town near you if you can be bothered / compelled as I've been.</p>
				<p>Of course I'm not serious, but why the hell are the instructions to make bread, so poor.</p>
				<p>It's been a while since I made a loaf of bread, but I used to cook quite a lot, so I feel fairly confident in the kitchen. Yet it's just taken me three attempts to get passable bread, and It is annoying.</p>
				<p>I remember not reading instructions when I used to cook. For some reason, twice I tried to follow the instructions to the letter. Well, to call the result sub-par would be an insult to things of sub-par quality.</p>
				<p>My first two loaves had some issues. I used a square pyrex dish for the first, and didn't score the top, or leave to cool. I likely used way too much butter, because the instructions said to use 25g of butter, when making bread.</p>
				<p>The second loaf was mildly funny, but totally inedible. Again I cut too soon without leaving to cool, I forgot to score, but at least it was partially bread shaped as I used a bread tin.</p>
				<p>On my third attempt. I huffed and I puffed, and... Well, I just didn't read the damn instructions. Muscle memory went a lot better than instructions, and I had edible, but not perfect bread, and a hint to leave the damn thing alone for 2 hours before cutting into it.</p>
				<p>I shall try again in the coming days, once I procure more flour.</p>
				<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Warm water, yeast and sugar mix before flour.</li>
					<li>No butter, lightly oil pan</li>
					<li>Use your best judgement with salt in teaspoons.</li>
					<li>Eyeball, rather than clock-time the dough doubling.</li>
					<li>Score the top of the bread you make.</li>
					<li>leave to cool for 2 hours before cutting or eating.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Things to try next-time</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I wish to try steam to make the bread rise higher.</li>
					<li>I'd like to experiment with herbs and seeds.</li>
					<li>I'd like to experiment with flavours.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>I want to make 99/100 consecutive loaves of bread, with a consistently positive outcome.</p>
				<p>I'd like to try different shapes and flavours, like citrus infused bread.</p>
				<p>I'd like to continue having fun, and not reading the instructions.</p>
				<p>Perhaps once I've achieved consistency. Write some good instructions.</li>
